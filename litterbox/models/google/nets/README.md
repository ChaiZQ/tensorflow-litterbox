# Models from Google Tensorflow 

These models were taken from tensorflow/models/slim/nets 

They are also in the main tensorflow repository at tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/nets/ minus the factory.

These networks were last update from revision https://github.com/tensorflow/models/commit/253ca4ab8101dc2c2404530680b4a12e7518572d

## TODO

Remove model code and just use the tf.contrib.slim versions with same factory? Will this make it harder to do model surgery? TBD
